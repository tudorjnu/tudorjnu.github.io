Hello, world! I am a Ph.D. student in Artificial Intelligence, working predominantly with deep learning and reinforcement learning to enhance the autonomy within endovascular navigation.

Today, I am taking a step that's a little daunting, - I'm starting a blog. My reasons are manifold. I hope it will help keep me accountable to my commitments and document my journey. I also aspire to find like-minded individuals with whom I can grow.

Although I have always entertained the idea of starting a blog, I find always procrastinated and/or hidden my nervousness within procrastination. There's a certain cultural backdrop of "do not show off" that I carry. Our society often appreciates conformity, and I was raised in the mould of "don't look stupid" or "don't look too smart." But today, I'm trying to step out of those confines.

So why am I starting this blog? My motivations and inspirations are primarily to deepen my learning and expand my interaction with others. I hope to establish a network that fosters creativity and collaboration. My goal? Proficiency. As the saying goes, "to teach is to learn twice," and I believe this blog will serve as a platform for that.

What value do I hope to bring to you? I aim to keep my blog straightforward and to the point. Nobody wants to spend a whole day poring over a blog post, and I promise to respect your time. But this space is also for me. It's a place where I can cast my thoughts, express myself, and connect with others in a way that social media never offered me.

I am acutely aware that this journey will be littered with mistakes. But being human means erring, and I am ready to embrace this and get started now, refining and improving as I go along. I would rather put something out there, imperfect as it may be, than hold back something perfect that is never shared.

As for what you can expect from this blog, I plan to document my learning journey and the projects I undertake. Currently, I am addressing my gaps in computer science by engaging with the open source society university [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) on computer science, and I am also navigating through [Odin](https://www.theodinproject.com/), another open-source project for web development.

Most of the content will be published right here on this blog, with a post going up once a month. Your engagement is highly appreciated, so feel free to leave a comment or drop me a message. My socials are all attached, and I look forward to your thoughts and feedback.

In conclusion, I am thrilled and committed to embarking on this journey. I invite you all to join me, as I look forward to the lessons I will learn and the connections I will make. My hope for this blog's future is that it becomes a space for growth, collaboration, and discovery.

To stay updated, I encourage you to subscribe, follow, or share this blog. I'd also love to hear your thoughts or experiences in the comments. And keep an eye out for my upcoming posts. I am excited to share this journey with you all.

Here's to learning, growing, and blogging together!
