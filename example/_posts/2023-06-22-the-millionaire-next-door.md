"The Millionaire Next Door" is an exploration of the habits and behaviors of wealthy individuals in America. Authored by Thomas J. Stanley and William D. Danko, both accomplished scholars in the realm of personal finance and consumer behavior, the book serves to shatter common misconceptions about wealth and how it is accrued.


##  Frugality
The book extols the virtue of **frugality**, a trait often overlooked in our consumer-driven society. It's not about how much you earn, but how much you keep. The authors provide ample evidence that the truly wealthy often live in a manner that may seem surprisingly modest.

## Living Below Your Means
The authors advocate for a lifestyle that is **below one's means**, a concept that is simple yet profound. By resisting the urge to inflate our lifestyles with our incomes, we can create a surplus that leads to wealth.

## Negotiation
**Negotiation**, as the book suggests, is not just a skill but a necessity. The authors argue that the ability to negotiate can significantly impact one's financial health, a concept that resonates in our daily transactions. One can negotiate most of the things, from a car to his property.

## Avoiding Discrepancies
The book warns against the creation of **discrepancies in possessions**, a trap that can lead to financial instability. The authors argue that maintaining a balance in our possessions is a key aspect of financial health. For example having an item of a high-value (even if it is received as a gift)
  can create discrepancies in ones belongings, thus making the person striving to bring the other belongings to the same value as the high-value item.

## Calculating Expected Net Worth
The book unfolds around several key themes: the economic behavior of affluent individuals, the relationship between spending habits and wealth accumulation, and the categorization of individuals as either a **prodigious accumulator of wealth (PAW)** or **under accumulator of wealth (UAW)**. Based on this, the authors provide a method to determine whether one is a PAW or UAW:

1. Multiply your age by your realized (taxable) annual income.
2. Divide by 10.
3. Subtract any inherited wealth.
4. The result is your expected net worth, or what you should be worth, given your income and age.

Based on the result, the authors further classify individuals into two categories. If your actual net worth places you in the top quartile (25%) for your age and income, you are considered a PAW or "prodigious accumulator of wealth". Conversely, if you fall in the bottom quartile (25%), you are labelled as a UAW, or "under-accumulator of wealth".

To solidify your standing in the PAW category according to "The Millionaire Next Door" formula, your net worth should be at least twice your expected net worth. PAWs frequently have four times the wealth of UAWs in their income and age group. Conversely, if you have half or less than the expected net worth for your category, you fall under the UAW classification.

## Conclusion
"The Millionaire Next Door" offers a refreshing perspective on wealth accumulation, advocating for frugality, living below one's means, negotiation, balance in possessions, and provides a way to estimate ones net worth.
