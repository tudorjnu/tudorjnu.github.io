Setting up JupyterHub as a server means that it will be available as soon as the PC boots up without manually launching it. To do this, you need miniconda installed.

1. **Create a Conda Virtual Environment**:

   ```bash
   conda create -n jupyter_env python=3.9
   ```

2. **Activate the Environment**:

   ```bash
   conda activate jupyter_env
   ```

3. **Install Necessary Libraries**:

   ```bash
   conda install -c conda-forge jupyterhub jupyterlab nodejs nb_conda_kernels
   ```

4. **Create a Systemd Service File**:
   Use `sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/jupyterhub.service` and fill it with the following content (ensure to replace `<your_user>` with your actual username):

   ```
   [Unit]
   Description=JupyterHub
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   User=root
   Environment="PATH=/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/home/<your_user>/miniconda3/envs/jupyter_env/bin:/home/<your_user>/miniconda3/bin"
   ExecStart=/home/<your_user>/miniconda3/envs/jupyter_env/bin/jupyterhub

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

5. **Reload the Service Daemon**:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```

6. **Start the JupyterHub Service**:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start jupyterhub
   ```

7. **Enable JupyterHub Service**:
   This will ensure it automatically starts at boot time.

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable jupyterhub
   ```

8. **Access JupyterHub**:
   Navigate to `localhost:8000` and log in using your Linux credentials.

9. **Use Jupyter**:
   After logging in, you can access a full-fledged Jupyter server in classic mode (`/tree`) or the more recent JupyterLab (`/lab`).

The standout feature of this setup is its ability to detect kernels in all conda environments. This means you can access these kernels effortlessly. Simply install the required kernel in your desired environment (e.g., `conda install ipykernel` or `conda install irkernel`) and restart the Jupyter server from the JupyterHub control panel.
