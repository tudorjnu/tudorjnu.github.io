## [Deep Work](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25744928-deep-work) | Carl Newport

> If you can’t learn, you can’t thrive.

> Ironically, jobs are actually easier to enjoy than free time, because like flow activities they have built-in goals, feedback rules, and challenges, all of which encourage one to become involved in one’s work, to concentrate and lose oneself in it. Free time, on the other hand, is unstructured, and requires much greater effort to be shaped into something that can be enjoyed.

1. Avoid distractions when working
2. Embrace Boredom, it's a source of creative thinking 
3. Quit social media
4. Do not work overtime!

## [How to Win Friend and Influence People](How to Win Friends and Influence People) | Dale Carnegie

> Any fool can criticize, complain, and condemn—and most fools do. But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving.

> You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.

1. Why will anyone care about what you are if you are not interested in what they are?
2. Spread the love, one smile at a time
3. Remember the name, it is the only unique word assign to a person
4. Leave others better than before
5. Avoid arguments at all cost!

> Whatever your income, always live below your means.

1. Be frugal
2. Wealth is invisible
3. If someone is having a £100k car, all you know is that he has £100k less than before

## [I Will Teach You To Be Rich](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/40591670) | Ramit Sethi
> "Spend extravagantly on the things you love, and cut costs mercilessly on the things you don’t."

> "The 85 Percent Solution: Getting started is more important than becoming an expert."

2. Maximize the pension contribution
